        <p>
          I'm an AI Engineering Lead working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, enterprise systems, and applied research. With 10+ years of experience, my work focuses on building intelligent systems that are grounded in first principles and capable of operating reliably at real-world scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematics sits at the center of how I think. It has always been my favorite subject, and I often use it as a way to reason about complexity. I'm drawn to reducing problems to their fundamentals, expressing ideas precisely, and understanding the structures that govern systems. This perspective shapes how I approach AI models, system design, and engineering trade-offs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, my role has evolved into engineering leadership. I lead teams while staying close to the work—thinking deeply about architecture, model behavior, scalability, and long-term maintainability. I value rigor, but I'm far more concerned with whether a system behaves sensibly under real constraints, holds up to edge cases, and continues to make sense as it grows and changes over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of AI, literature is where I think differently. I write poetry and short stories, and books have always been a constant presence in my life. I aspire to build a personal library as a space for sustained thinking across disciplines, ideas, and time.
