        <p>
          I'm an AI Solution Architect, aspiring researcher, and lifelong learner, constantly exploring the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies. With over <strong>8.5 years of experience</strong> working with MNCs, a Big Four consulting firm, and a Google subsidiary, I specialize in developing enterprise-wide AI solutions, ensuring they are scalable, efficient, and impactful.
        </p>
        <p> 
          My academic journey began with a <strong>B.Tech in Electrical Engineering</strong>, and I'm currently pursuing a <strong>Master's in Artificial Intelligence</strong> from IU, Germany. Mathematics has always been my greatest fascination—my favorite subject and a lens through which I wish to understand the world. I dream of breaking down every phenomenon into equations, uncovering the elegant logic behind nature, technology, and human behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond AI and math, literature is my creative escape. I love writing poetry and short stories, and my passion for books 
          drives my dream of building a vast personal library—an ever-growing repository of knowledge and inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work, writing, and research, I aim to bridge the gap between AI innovation and real-world applications, 
          all while seeking beauty in numbers and storytelling.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Join me in discussing AI, math, and literature—I'd love to hear your thoughts!</strong></p>
